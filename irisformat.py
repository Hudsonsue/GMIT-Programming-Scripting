# iris dataset formatting exercise 6
# G00219132 Susan Hudson Programming and Scripting.
# this script opens the Iris dataset csv file
# for each line of the dataset it displays the first four values in columns of 5 characters width

with open ("irisdata.csv") as f:

     for line in f:

         print ('{:5} {:5} {:5} {:5}'.format(line.split (',')[0], line.split (',')[1], line.split(',')[2], line.split (',')[3]))

         ## note - had been getting index error messages when running, attempted to tidy up at work but did not have access to dataset. 
         ## downloaded dataset again from a different source and re wrote script printing unformatted, column by column then formatting
         ## no index errors so am assuming problem was within original dataset not my script
