# GMIT-Programming-Scripting
Python exercises - *Programming and Scripting Module CRN 52167*

This contains the attempts of Student **G00219132, Susan Hudson** for Python exercises as outlined below

This module also introduced students to use of Visual Studio code and the use of Github. Code has been transferred from visual studio code to github repository.

**Exercise 1:** Change a program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3 etc. Here is a wiki page about [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

**Exercise 2:** Using the example programme given change a string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. Explain what ord() does, using Google to find out. here is an explanition of the [ord function python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/ord)

**Exercise 3:** This is a Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function to it. Here is a wiki page about the [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

**Exercise 4:** Problem 5 from Project Euler. [Problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

**Exercise 5:** Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format.The Iris data set is widely used in data analytics and a wiki page devoted to the Iris data set can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

**Exercise 6:** Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. Factorials are explained in the wiki page, [Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
