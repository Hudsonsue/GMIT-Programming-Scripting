# GMIT-Programming-Scripting
Python exercises - *Programming and Scripting Module CRN 52167*

## Purpose ## 
This repository contains the attempts of Student **G00219132, Susan Hudson** for Python exercises as outlined below. The module is delivered as part of the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/computing/higher-diploma-science-computing-data-analytics-ict-skills) in GMIT.

This module also introduced students to use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the use of [Github](https://github.com/). Code has been transferred from visual studio code to github repository.

#### Exercise descriptions ####
**Exercise 1:** Change a program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3 etc. Here is a wiki page about [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

**Exercise 2:** Using the example programme given I changed a string variable to contain my own surname, and reran it. I also explained what ord() does having used Google to find out. Here is an explanation of the [ord function in python.](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/ord)

**Exercise 3:** This is a Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function to it. Here is a wiki page about the [collatz conjecture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

**Exercise 4:** This is a Python script to solve Problem 5 from Project Euler. [Euler Problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5). It proved to be the most difficult of all exercises set, mainly because there were so many possible approaches and I wanted to find an approach that I fully understood. It was the exercise that almost caused me to give up and which I spent a huge deal of time on. It reinforced my personal preference for coding that does stuff rather than solves stuff! This a hangover to my previous student days and using Modula-2 to solve hideous equations. [MM Novak lectured me and we used his book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modula-2-Science-Engineering-M-M-Novak/dp/0077072006). Still in my garage somewhere ...

**Exercise 5:** This is a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format.The Iris data set is widely used in data analytics and a wiki page devoted to the Iris data set can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

**Exercise 6:** This is a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. Factorials are explained in the wiki page, [Factorial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

## Code language ##
All coding is [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/)
