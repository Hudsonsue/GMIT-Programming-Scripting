# Week 1 Exercise
# my name is Susan, so the first and last letter of my name (S+N = 19+14)
# give the number 33, Fibonacci number is 3524578

#Week 2 Exercise
# My surname is Hudson
# The first letter H is number 72
# The last letter n is number 110
# Fibonacci number 182 is 48558529144435440119720805669229197641
# Ord() is returning the unicode value of the characters specified --in my case H and n.
